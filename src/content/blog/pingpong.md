## About

I made this animation because of how popular ping-pong is among DMD and CGGT students (we have a ping-pong table in the Dungeon, a room in the basement of engineering where graphics students hang out).

I downloaded a simple ball rig and the rest of the scene is composed of primitives like cubes and planes. I used pose-to-pose animation, focusing on snappier animation.
