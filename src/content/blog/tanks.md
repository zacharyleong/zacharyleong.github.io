## Rethinking Traditional Tank Controls
In most traditional computer tank games, movement is controlled by 2 keys for rotating the hull, a key for moving forward, and a key for moving backward.

Consider the WASD tank controls in World of Tanks:


<iframe src="/html/tanks_demo_1.html" 
        width="300"
        height="300" 
        style="border: 1px solid #ccc; overflow: hidden;" 
        allow="fullscreen">
</iframe>
